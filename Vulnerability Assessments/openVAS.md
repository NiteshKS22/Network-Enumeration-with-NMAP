## OPENVAS ASSEMENTS

You have been contracted by the company Inlanefreight to perform an internal vulnerability assessment against one of their servers. They have asked for a cursory assessment to be performed to identify any significant vulnerabilities as they do not have the budget for a full-scale penetration test this year. The results of this vulnerability assessment may enable the CISO to push for additional funding from the Board of Directors to perform more in-depth security testing.
