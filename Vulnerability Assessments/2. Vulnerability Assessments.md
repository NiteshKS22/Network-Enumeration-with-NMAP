## VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

It aims to identify and categorize risks for security weakness related to assets within an enviraments. it is important there is little to no manual exploitation during a vulnerability assessments.

it provide us with step by step to fix the issue.

### Purpose

- understand  -|
- identify    -| --- RISK
- categorize  -|

As with any assessment, it is essential to clarify the scope and intent of the vulnerability assessment before starting. vulnerability management is vital to help organization identity the weak points in their assets, understand the risk lieve;l, asnd calculate and prioitize remediation efforts.

## UNDERSTANDING KEY TERMS

### Vulnerability

It's a weakness or bug in an organization's enviroment, including applications, network and infra that opens up possibility of threat from external actors. it can be registered through MITRE's [CVE database](https://www.cve.org/) and receive a CVSS score to determine severity.

```
THREAT                            +             VULNERABILITY                 =      RISK
A new incident with potenitial                  Known weakness that hackers          The Potential for damage when
to harm a system                                Could Exploit                        a threat exploits a vulnerability
```

Exploit -- is any code or resources that can be used to take advantage of an asset's weakness. this can be open source available through platform such as [Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) or [rapid7 exploit DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/)

- RISK : Something bad that could happen
- THREAT : Something bad is happening
- Vulnerabilities : weakness that could lead to a threat

## ASSEST MANAGEMENT

  When an organization of any kind, in any industry, and of any size needs to plan their cybersecurity strategy, they should start by creating an inventory of their data assets.
u have to know what are u protecting once u have inventoried, then you can start the process of assest management. ` this is a key concept in defensive security`


## Application and System Inventory

An organization should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for defensive security. Data assets include:

- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.

- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more. Sometimes corporate networks are "multi-cloud," meaning they have more than one cloud provider. A company's cloud provider will provide tools that can be used to inventory all of the data stored by that particular cloud provider.

- All data stored within various Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. These are often consumer services or the "business" version of those services. Think of online services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Apple iCloud, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Office 365, Google Docs, and the list goes on.

- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. Including applications that are deployed locally and applications that are deployed through the cloud or are otherwise Software-as-a-Service.

- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to routers, firewalls, hubs, switches, dedicated intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS), data loss prevention (DLP) systems, and so on.

All of these assets are very important. A threat actor or any other sort of risk to any of these assets can do significant damage to a company's information security and ability to operate day by day. An organization needs to take its time to assess everything and be careful not to miss a single data asset, or they won't be able to protect it.

Organizations frequently add or remove computers, data storage, cloud server capacity, or other data assets. Whenever data assets are added or removed, this must be thoroughly noted in the data asset inventory.
