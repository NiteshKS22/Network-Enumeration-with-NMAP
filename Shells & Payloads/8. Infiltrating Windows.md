# INFILTRATING WINDOWS

## ENUMERATING WINDOWS

The first one being the Time To Live (TTL) counter when utilizing ICMP to determine if the host is up. A typical response from a Windows host will either be 32 or 128. A response of or around 128 is the most common response you will see. This value may not always be exact, especially if you are not in the same layer three network as the target. We can utilize this value since most hosts will never be more than 20 hops away from your point of origin, so there is little chance of the TTL counter dropping into the acceptable values of another OS type. In the ping output below, we can see an example of this. For the example, we pinged a Windows 10 host and can see we have received replies with a TTL of 128. Check out this link for a nice table showing other TTL values by OS.

### Pinged Host

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ ping 192.168.86.39 

PING 192.168.86.39 (192.168.86.39): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=0 ttl=128 time=102.920 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=1 ttl=128 time=9.164 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=2 ttl=128 time=14.223 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.86.39: icmp_seq=3 ttl=128 time=11.265 ms
```

Another way we can validate if the host is Windows or not is to use our handy tool, NMAP. Nmap has a cool capability built in to help with OS identification and many other scripted scans to check for anything from a specific vulnerability to information gathered from SNMP. For this example, we will utilize the -O option with verbose output -v to initialize an OS Identification scan against our target 192.168.86.39. As we scroll through the shell session below and look at the results, a few things give this away as a Windows host. We will focus on those here in a minute. Look carefully at the bottom of the shell session. We can see the point labeled OS CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows_10 and OS details: Microsoft Windows 10 1709 - 1909. Nmap made this guess based on several different metrics it derives from the TCP/IP stack. It uses those qualities to determine the OS as it checks it against a database of OS fingerprints. In this case, Nmap has determined that our host is a Windows 10 machine with a revision level between 1709 & 1909.

If you run into issues and the scans turn up little results, attempt again with the -A and -Pn options. This will perform a different scan and may work. For more info on how this process works, check out this article from the Nmap Documentation. Be careful of this detection method. Implementing a firewall or other security features can obscure the host or mess the results up. When possible, use more than one check to make a determination.

Now that we know we are dealing with a Windows 10 host, we need to enumerate the services we can see to determine if we have a potential avenue of exploitation. To perform banner grabbing, we can use several different tools. Netcat, Nmap, and many others can perform the enumeration we need, but for this instance, we will look at a simple Nmap script called banner.nse. For each port Nmap sees as up, it will attempt to connect to the port and glean any information it can from it. In the session below, Nmap tried to connect to each port, but the only ports to give back a response were ports 902 and 912. Based on the page banner, they have something to do with VMWare Workstation. We can attempt to find an exploit dealing with that protocol, or we can further enumerate the other ports. In a real pentest, you will want to be as thorough as possible, making sure you have the full lay of the land.
