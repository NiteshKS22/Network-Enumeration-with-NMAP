# Introductions

shell is a program that provide a computer user with an interface to input instructions into the system ans view text output (bash, zsh, cmd, and powershell)

## Why get a shell

Shell give us direct access to the OS, system commands, and file system. so if we gain access we can start enumerating the system for previlage escalation, pivot, transfer files, and more.

establishing a shell also allow us to maintain presistence on the system, give us more time to work.

Establishing a shell almost alwyas means that we are accessing the CLI of the OS it can be windows, unix etc etc. and this make us harder to notice than if we were remotely accessing a graphical shell over VNC or RDP.

| **Computing**             | The text-based userland environment that is utilized to administer tasks and submit instructions on a PC. Think Bash, Zsh, cmd, and PowerShell.                |
| **Exploitation & Security** | A shell is often the result of exploiting a vulnerability or bypassing security measures to gain interactive access to a host. An example would be triggering EternalBlue on a Windows host to gain access to the cmd-prompt on a host remotely. |
| **Web**                   | A web shell is much like a standard shell, except it exploits a vulnerability (often the ability to upload a file or script) that provides the attacker with a way to issue instructions, read and access files, and potentially perform destructive actions to the underlying host. Control of the web shell is often done by calling the script within a browser window. |


Payloads Deliver us Shells

Within the IT industry as a whole, a payload can be defined in a few different ways:

- Networking: The encapsulated data portion of a packet traversing modern computer networks.
- Basic Computing: A payload is the portion of an instruction set that defines the action to be taken. Headers and protocol information removed.
- Programming: The data portion referenced or carried by the programming language instruction.
- Exploitation & Security: A payload is code crafted with the intent to exploit a vulnerability on a computer system. The term payload can describe various types of malware, including but not limited to ransomware.
