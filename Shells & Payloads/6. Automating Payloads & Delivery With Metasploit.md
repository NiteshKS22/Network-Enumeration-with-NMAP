# Automating Payloads & Delivery with Metasploit


Metasploit is attack framework that was developed by rapid7 that streamline the process of exploiting vulnerabilities through the use of pre-built modules that contain easy to use options to exploit vulnerabilities and diliver the payloads to gain the shell.

start with the Nmap to find the ports to targets

```
nmap -sC -sV -Pn <IP>
```

### EXAMPLE

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sC -sV -Pn 10.129.164.25

Host discovery disabled (-Pn). All addresses will be marked 'up' and scan times will be slower.
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-09 21:03 UTC

| 56           | The number assigned to the module in the table within the context of the search. This number makes it easier to select. We can use the command `use 56` to select the module. |
| exploit/     | This defines the type of module. In this case, this is an exploit module. Many exploit modules in MSF include the payload that attempts to establish a shell session. |
| windows/     | This defines the platform we are targeting. In this case, we know the target is Windows, so the exploit and payload will be for Windows. |
| smb/         | This defines the service for which the payload in the module is written.                     |
| psexec       | This defines the tool that will get uploaded to the target system if it is vulnerable.      |

meterpreter >
```


After we issue the exploit command, the exploit is run, and there is an attempt to deliver the payload onto the target utilizing the Meterpreter payload. Metasploit reports back each step of this process, as seen in the output. We know this was successful because a stage was sent successfully, which established a Meterpreter shell session (meterpreter >) and a system-level shell session. Keep in mind that Meterpreter is a payload that uses in-memory DLL injection to stealthfully establish a communication channel between an attack box and a target. The proper credentials and attack vector can give us the ability to upload & download files, execute system commands, run a keylogger, create/start/stop services, manage processes, and more.

In this case, as detailed in the Rapid 7 Module Documentation: "This module uses a valid administrator username and password (or password hash) to execute an arbitrary payload. This module is similar to the "psexec" utility provided by SysInternals. This module is now able to clean up after itself. The service created by this tool uses a randomly chosen name and description. "

Like other command language interpreters (Bash, PowerShell, ksh, etc...), Meterpreter shell sessions allow us to issue a set of commands we can use to interact with the target system. We can use the ? to see a list of commands we can use. We will notice limitations with the Meterpreter shell, so it is good to attempt to use the shell command to drop into a system-level shell if we need to work with the complete set of system commands native to our target.

#### Interactive Shell

##
## QUESTIONS

**1.  What command language interpreter is used to establish a system shell session with the target?**

Powershell

**2.  Exploit the target using what you've learned in this section, then submit the name of the file located in htb-student's Documents folder. (Format: filename.extension)**
