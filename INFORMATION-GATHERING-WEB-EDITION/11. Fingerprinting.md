# FINGERPRINTING

It focuses on extracting technical details about the technologies powering a website or web application, the digital signatures of web servers, OS, and software components can reveal critical informations.

this can attract the attackers to tailor attack and exploit vulnerabilities specific to identified tech.

### Fingerprinting Techniques

- Banner Grabbing: Banner grabbing involves analysing the banners presented by web servers and other services. These banners often reveal the server software, version numbers, and other details.
- Analysing HTTP Headers: HTTP headers transmitted with every web page request and response contain a wealth of information. The Server header typically discloses the web server software, while the X-Powered-By header might reveal additional technologies like scripting languages or frameworks.
- Probing for Specific Responses: Sending specially crafted requests to the target can elicit unique responses that reveal specific technologies or versions. For example, certain error messages or behaviours are characteristic of particular web servers or software components.
- Analysing Page Content: A web page's content, including its structure, scripts, and other elements, can often provide clues about the underlying technologies. There may be a copyright header that indicates specific software being used, for example.

#### Baaner Grabbing

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com
```

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ curl -I inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently

#### Wafw00f

Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) are security solutions designed to protect web applications from various attacks. Before proceeding with further fingerprinting, it's crucial to determine if inlanefreight.com employs a WAF, as it could interfere with our probes or potentially block our requests.

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ wafw00f inlanefreight.com

        The Web Application Firewall Fingerprinting Toolkit
    
[*] Checking https://inlanefreight.com
[+] The site https://inlanefreight.com is behind Wordfence (Defiant) WAF.
[~] Number of requests: 2
```

The wafw00f scan on inlanefreight.com reveals that the website is protected by the Wordfence Web Application Firewall (WAF), developed by Defiant.

This means the site has an additional security layer that could block or filter our reconnaissance attempts. In a real-world scenario, it would be crucial to keep this in mind as you proceed with further investigation, as you might need to adapt techniques to bypass or evade the WAF's detection mechanisms

#### NIKTO

Nikto is a powerful open-source web server scanner. In addition to its primary function as a vulnerability assessment tool, Nikto's fingerprinting capabilities provide insights into a website's technology stack.

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ nikto -h inlanefreight.com -Tuning b
```



The reconnaissance scan on inlanefreight.com reveals several key findings:

- IPs: The website resolves to both IPv4 (134.209.24.248) and IPv6 (2a03:b0c0:1:e0::32c:b001) addresses.
- Server Technology: The website runs on Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
- WordPress Presence: The scan identified a WordPress installation, including the login page (/wp-login.php). This suggests the site might be a potential target for common WordPress-related exploits.
- Information Disclosure: The presence of a license.txt file could reveal additional details about the website's software components.
- Headers: Several non-standard or insecure headers were found, including a missing Strict-Transport-Security header and a potentially insecure x-redirect-by header.
