## ENUMERATION PRINCIPLE

Its stands for Information gathering using active (scans) and passives (using of thrird-party prociders) methods.

`OSNIT` is independent precedure and should be performed separately from enumeration because OSNIT based is exclusively on passive information gathering.

Information can be gathered from `domains`, `IP address`, `accessible services`, and many other sources.
We have to understand how infrastucture is setup and what technical aspects and services are necessary to be able to offer a specific service.

We can try to `Brute force` password specific service but it will be noisy metho and can lead to blacklist, then it will bbe more dificult to pentest the target.

We have to also try to understand company's defensive security measures and its infrasucture.

Enumeration Principles are based on some questions that will faciliate all our investigation.

```
What can we see?
What reasons can we have for seeing it?
What image does what we see create for us?
What do we gain from it?
How can we use it?
What can we not see?
What reasons can there be that we do not see?
What image results for us from what we do not see?
```

 Another advantage of these principles is that we can see from the practical tasks that we do not lack penetration testing abilities but technical understanding when we suddenly do not know how to proceed because our core task is not to exploit the machines but to find how they can be exploited.

| 1   | There is more than meets the eye. Consider all points of view. |
| 2   | Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.    |
| 3   | There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target. |
