## ORACLE TNS(transparent Network Substrate)

it's a communication protocol that facilitates communication b/w oracle db and application over networks.

It support various networking protocols such as `IPX/SPX` and `TCP/IP` protocol stacks.

In addition, its built-in encryption mechanism ensures the security of data transmitted, making it an ideal solution for enterprise environments where data security is paramount.

Over time TNS has make support of new tech like IPv6 and SSL/TLS encryption suitable for following purposes - 
 - Name resolution
 - Connection Management
 - Load Balancing
 - Security

it also enables encryption b/w client and server communication through an additional layer of security TCP/IP protocol layer.

## Default Configuration

 Oracle TNS. By default, the listener listens for incoming connections on the TCP/1521 port. However, this default port can be changed during installation or later in the configuration file. The TNS listener is configured to support various network protocols, including TCP/IP, UDP, IPX/SPX, and AppleTalk. The listener can also support multiple network interfaces and listen on specific IP addresses or all available network interfaces. By default, Oracle TNS can be remotely managed in Oracle 8i/9i but not in Oracle 10g/11g.

 TNS listener also includes a few basic security features. For example, the listener will only accept connections from authorized hosts and perform basic authentication using a combination of hostnames, IP addresses, and usernames and passwords. Additionally, the listener will use Oracle Net Services to encrypt the communication between the client and the server. The configuration files for Oracle TNS are called tnsnames.ora and listener.ora and are typically located in the $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin directory. The plain text file contains configuration information for Oracle database instances and other network services that uses the TNS protocol.

 Oracle DBSNMP, Oracle Databases, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise Manager, Oracle Fusion Middleware, web servers, and many more. There have been made many changes for the default installation of Oracle services. For example, Oracle 9 has a default password, CHANGE_ON_INSTALL, whereas Oracle 10 has no default password set. The Oracle DBSNMP service also uses a default password, dbsnmp that we should remember when we come across this one. Another example would be that many organizations still use the finger service together with Oracle, which can put Oracle's service at risk and make it vulnerable when we have the required knowledge of a home directory.

 ### Tnsnames.ora

 ```
ORCL =
  (DESCRIPTION =
    (ADDRESS_LIST =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = 10.129.11.102)(PORT = 1521))
    )
    (CONNECT_DATA =
      (SERVER = DEDICATED)
      (SERVICE_NAME = orcl)
    )
  )
```

Here we can see a service called ORCL, which is listening on port TCP/1521 on the IP address 10.129.11.102. Clients should use the service name orcl when connecting to the service. However, the tnsnames.ora file can contain many such entries for different databases and services. The entries can also include additional information, such as authentication details, connection pooling settings, and load balancing configurations.

On the other hand, the listener.ora file is a server-side configuration file that defines the listener process's properties and parameters, which is responsible for receiving incoming client requests and forwarding them to the appropriate Oracle database instance.

### Listener.ora

```
SID_LIST_LISTENER =
  (SID_LIST =
    (SID_DESC =
      (SID_NAME = PDB1)
      (ORACLE_HOME = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1)
      (GLOBAL_DBNAME = PDB1)
      (SID_DIRECTORY_LIST =
        (SID_DIRECTORY =
          (DIRECTORY_TYPE = TNS_ADMIN)
          (DIRECTORY = C:\oracle\product\19.0.0\dbhome_1\network\admin)
        )
      )
    )
  )

LISTENER =
  (DESCRIPTION_LIST =
    (DESCRIPTION =
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = orcl.inlanefreight.htb)(PORT = 1521))
      (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = IPC)(KEY = EXTPROC1521))
    )
  )

ADR_BASE_LISTENER = C:\oracle
```

In short, the client-side Oracle Net Services software uses the tnsnames.ora file to resolve service names to network addresses, while the listener process uses the listener.ora file to determine the services it should listen to and the behavior of the listener.

Oracle databases can be protected by using so-called PL/SQL Exclusion List (PlsqlExclusionList). It is a user-created text file that needs to be placed in the $ORACLE_HOME/sqldeveloper directory, and it contains the names of PL/SQL packages or types that should be excluded from execution. Once the PL/SQL Exclusion List file is created, it can be loaded into the database instance. It serves as a blacklist that cannot be accessed through the Oracle Application Server.

## NMAP

We can see that the port is open, and the service is running. In Oracle RDBMS, a System Identifier (SID) is a unique name that identifies a particular database instance. It can have multiple instances, each with its own System ID. An instance is a set of processes and memory structures that interact to manage the database's data. When a client connects to an Oracle database, it specifies the database's SID along with its connection string. The client uses this SID to identify which database instance it wants to connect to. Suppose the client does not specify a SID. Then, the default value defined in the tnsnames.ora file is used.

The SIDs are an essential part of the connection process, as it identifies the specific instance of the database the client wants to connect to. If the client specifies an incorrect SID, the connection attempt will fail. Database administrators can use the SID to monitor and manage the individual instances of a database. For example, they can start, stop, or restart an instance, adjust its memory allocation or other configuration parameters, and monitor its performance using tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager.

There are various ways to enumerate, or better said, guess SIDs. Therefore we can use tools like nmap, hydra, odat, and others. Let us use nmap first.

We can use the odat.py tool to perform a variety of scans to enumerate and gather information about the Oracle database services and its components. Those scans can retrieve database names, versions, running processes, user accounts, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, etc. Let us use the all option and try all modules of the odat.py tool.

## ODAT

Oracle Database Attacking Tool (ODAT) is an open-source penetration testing tool written in Python and designed to enumerate and exploit vulnerabilities in Oracle databases. It can be used to identify and exploit various security flaws in Oracle databases, including SQL injection, remote code execution, and privilege escalation.

We can follow many approaches once we get access to an Oracle database. It highly depends on the information we have and the entire setup. However, we can not add new users or make any modifications. From this point, we could retrieve the password hashes from the sys.user$ and try to crack them offline. The query for this would look like the following:

```
SQL> select name, password from sys.user$;

NAME                           PASSWORD
------------------------------ ------------------------------
SYS                            FBA343E7D6C8BC9D

```


Another option is to upload a web shell to the target. However, this requires the server to run a web server, and we need to know the exact location of the root directory for the webserver. Nevertheless, if we know what type of system we are dealing with, we can try the default paths, which are:

```
OS	   |  Path
----------------------
Linux	 | /var/www/html
Windows| C:\inetpub\wwwroot

```

First, trying our exploitation approach with files that do not look dangerous for Antivirus or Intrusion detection/prevention systems is always important. Therefore, we create a text file with a string and use it to upload to the target system.

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ echo "Oracle File Upload Test" > testing.txt
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ ./odat.py utlfile -s 10.129.204.235 -d XE -U scott -P tiger --sysdba --putFile C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot testing.txt ./testing.txt

[1] (10.129.204.235:1521): Put the ./testing.txt local file in the C:\inetpub\wwwroot folder like testing.txt on the 10.129.204.235 server                                                                                                  
[+] The ./testing.txt file was created on the C:\inetpub\wwwroot directory on the 10.129.204.235 server like the testing.txt file
```

Finally, we can test if the file upload approach worked with curl. Therefore, we will use a GET http://<IP> request, or we can visit via browser.

```
NiteshKS22@htb[/htb]$ curl -X GET http://10.129.204.235/testing.txt

Oracle File Upload Test
```
